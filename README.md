# Avocado-Price-Prediction--EDA-and---Machine-Learning-Project
A repository of final project
### Abstract:

* Avocados seem to be increasingly popular among millennials. It was observed that over 2.6 billion pounds of avocado were consumed in the United States alone in 2020, as opposed to only 436 million pounds consumed in the year 1985, as per Statista. 

* Avocados are seen as a healthy option and are popular for being a good source of “good fats”. 
  The fruit can be spread on toast, eaten raw, or even consumed in the form of a shake. Guacamole, which is a Mexican dip, is also made from avocados. 

* Like most other products, the price of avocados fluctuates based on season and supply, which is why it would be beneficial to have a machine learning model to monitor and predict avocado prices.

### Content:

* The dataset below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. 

* Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. 

* The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

### Problem Statement:

*  More awareness of the sales and prices of avocados can benefit the vendors, producers, associations, and companies. Price prediction based on sales would be a good input in the market to determine shifting of produce to locations where the fruit is more in demand or even encouragement of consumption in places where demand is not up to the mark. 

* Due to the uncertainty in the prices, the company is not able to sell their produce at the optimal price.

* The idea here is to predict future prices based on data collected of past prices based on geographical location, weather changes, and seasonal availability of avocados.

### Study of Existing Systems:

* Avocado Price Prediction[EDA and ML]:
  Author: Abhijit Show - In this project,he did the analysis part and applied machine learning algorithms to predict the price    of an avocado.

  Author: Rohit negi -In this project,he aslo did the analysis part and applied machine learning algorithms to predict the price  of an avocado.
  
### Identification of gaps in existing systems:
 
 * Avocado Price Prediction - Author: Abhijit Show - In this project, he applied only three machine learning algorithms to predict the price of an avocado.
 
 * Avocado Price Prediction - Author: Rohit negi -In this project, he also applied only three machine learning algorithms to predict the price of an avocado.
 
### Proposed Solution:

* We can apply additional one more Machine learning algorithms Extra Tree Regressor and compare the best model by using the accuracy of each model and we can generate the Feature Importance to understand which feature is used to make key decisions.
 
### Main Objective:

* The main objective of this project is:

* Perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Avocado dataset.

* Build a suitable Machine Learning Model that will help vendors, producers, associations, and companies to predict the future prices of avocado

### Tools/Technology used to implement proposed solution:
